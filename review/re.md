# Review on "Regular Expression Equivalence via Derivatives"

### Overall Structure

### Minor Corrections

- `Deriv x A = {xs. x # xs âˆˆ A}`
  - Although the capitalization here emphasizes the correspondence between `Deriv` and `deriv`, it may also cause confusion in contexts where an explicit type annotation of its parameter is not present.
