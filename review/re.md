# Review on "Regular Expression Equivalence via Derivatives"

- >  `lang :: 'a rexp ⇒ 'a list set` 

  -  `lang :: 'a rexp ⇒ 'a lang` 

- > Special syntax is completely avoided

  - Seems irrelevant

- > Remember the standard definition of a language derivative

  - Motivation?

- > 4.1 Language Coinduction

  - Less automatic?

- > The following is the same for `'a rexp` instead of languages themselves.

  - What same? Why need it?
  - Is formal proof needed in the paper?

- > nderiv is a variant of deriv, explained below.

  - How much difference should be expected before reaching explanation?
