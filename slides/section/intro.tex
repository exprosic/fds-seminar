\item Zipper = context type, which helps moving through and ``modifying'' a functional data structure\footnote{Huet, GÃ©rard. "The zipper." Journal of functional programming 7.5 (1997): 549-554.}
\item Deriving context types vs.\ differentiating real-valued functions\footnote{McBride, Conor. "The derivative of a regular type is its type of one-hole contexts." Unpublished manuscript (2001): 74-88.}
\item Relation with combinatorial species\footnote{Yorgey, Brent. "Functional Pearl: Species and Functors and Types, Oh My!."}
\end{itemize}
